# Analysis Files for The Structure of Spatial Segregation

This repository contains code sufficient to reproduce all findings from "The Structure of Spatial Segregation," an in-submission paper on using information theory and machine learning to conduct novel multiscale segregation analysis. 

The analyses in this repository depend on the [`compx`](https://philchodrow.github.io/compx/) package for the `R` programming language, which makes available functions for regionalization and scale measurement. Install `compx` in `R` with the command  `devtools::install_github('PhilChodrow/compx')`.
