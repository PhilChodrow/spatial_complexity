		\begin{enumerate}[<+ ->]
			\item What is \alert<2>{\textbf{urban diversity}}, and how should we measure it? 
			\item What is a \alert<3>{\textbf{neighborhood}}, and how can we distinguish neighborhoods in principled ways?
		\end{enumerate}
		\onslide<4->{
			\begin{block}{Central Claim}
				These two questions are deeply related, and we should approach both using \emph{information theory}.

			\item[\alert<2>{Spatial evenness}] \textit{``or clustering, refers to the extent to which groups are similarly distributed in residential space.''} \cite{Reardon2004}
			\item[\alert<3>{Spatial exposure}] \textit{``refers to the extent that members of one group encounter members of another group (or their own group, in the case of spatial isolation) in their local spatial environments.''} \cite{Reardon2004}

		Information theory quantifies concepts like uncertainty and predictability. Why use it for studying race? 
		\onslide<2->{
			\begin{block}{Core Insight}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Complex systems allow \textbf{some} prediction...
					\item ...But good prediction is \textbf{hard}.
				\end{itemize}

		}
		\onslide<3>{
			\textbf{Examples of prediction:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If you pick a random person from a city, is it hard to guess their race? ``Yes'' $\implies$ more diverse city. 
				\item Does it help if you tell me where they live? ``Yes'' $\implies$ more uneven city. 
			\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}\frametitle{Entropy as Global Diversity}
		Let $p(X,Y)$ be the joint distribution of location $X$ and race $Y$. The marginal distribution of race alone is $p(Y) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x,Y)$. 
		\begin{block}{Entropy}

	\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mutual Information as Evenness}
		The mutual information quantifies the degree of dependence between two random variables.

			\begin{equation*}
			I(X,Y) \triangleq \sum_{x,y \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}}p(X,Y) \log \frac{p(X,Y)}{p(X)p(Y)}\;.

		\onslide<2->{\begin{align*}
			I(X,Y) = 0 &\implies \text{ location and race are independent} \\

	\begin{frame}\frametitle{Local Information}
		Let $I_r(x_0)$ be local the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$, restricted to a small area of radius $r$ centered at $x_0$. Think of this as the \textbf{spatial variation of racial trends in a small area.} 
		\onslide<2->{
			\begin{block}{Theorem}
				Under appropriate regularity conditions, for small $r$,
				\begin{equation*}
					\frac{I_r(x_0)}{r^2} \cong \frac{1}{4} \text{trace } J_Y(x_0)\;, \tag{proof on request}
				\end{equation*}
				where $J_Y(x_0)$ is the Fisher information in $Y$ about $x_0$ \nocite{Amari2000}
			\end{block}
		}
		\onslide<3->{
			\alert{Significance}: the local information $I_r(x_0)$ is related to an intrinsic statistical measure $J_Y(x)$ \emph{that is independent of the resolution $r$}.

	\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mean Local Information Measures Spatial Exposure}
		We're interested in the average value of local information:

	\begin{frame}\frametitle{How can we use this?}
		$H(Y)$, $I(X,Y)$, and $J(X,Y)$ measure diversity, evenness, and spatial exposure. 

		$J(X,Y)$ also measures ``neighborhoodiness.''
		
		\onslide<2->{Does can we use these measures to \textbf{find} neighborhoods?}

		\onslide<3->{Yes! 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We can use $I(X,Y)$ to find neighborhoods
				\item We can use $I(X,Y)$ and $J(X,Y)$ to estimate how many we need to preserve key patterns. 
				\item So, we can view $H(Y)$, $I(X,Y)$, and $J(X,Y)$ as measurements of \textbf{complexity} in spatiosocial structure.

	\begin{frame}{Relation of local and Fisher informations}
		Suppose that $p(y|x) > 0$ and that $p(y|x)$ is differentiable as a function of $x$ for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathcal{Y}$. Define $B_r \triangleq B_r(x_0) \triangleq \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \;|\; \lvert{x - x_0}\rvert \leq r \}$. Additionally, define the \emph{local mutual information} in $B_r$ as the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ where $X$ is restricted to $B_r$:
		\begin{align}
			I_r(x_0) &\triangleq \mathbb{E}_X[D[p(\cdot|X)\| p(\cdot|X \in B_r)]|X \in B_r] \\
			&= \int_{B_r} p(x|X \in B_r) D[p(\cdot|x)\| p(\cdot|X \in B_r)] d^n x\;.
		\end{align}
		where $D[p\|q] \triangleq \sum_{y} p(y) \log \frac{p(y)}{q(y)}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence of $q$ from $p$.

			The Fisher information matrix $J_Y$ is given by
